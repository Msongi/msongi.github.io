I am a qualified and registered Electronic engineer with a passion for Data Science and Machine Learning. As an engineer i've provided innovation consultancy on advanced technology SMEs in Europe and the United States. Projects in the fields of cyber security, automation, electrical engineering, health, finance, Big Data and AI. Since 2019 I have been a self taught Data Scientist and ML engineer. I have completed nanodegrees in Data Analysis, Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering with Udacity. I also have professional certificates in Data Science and AI from IBM.

My most recent internship was as a Machine Learning Specialist at an agile start-up environment developing an automated End-to-End Machine learning system able to automate 80% of the data science workflow, building algorithms from scratch. I have been recognized as an adaptive team player, problem solver and innovative thinker who excels at producing business value through applying data science best practices to challenging problems.

My expertise includes project design and management, Exploratory Data Analysis, data modelling, python programming and the development and implementation of research tools. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when faced with adversity
